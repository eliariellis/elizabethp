    Hoooooiiiii!! :3c

    Here's a list of changes that I made to the ur Project Folder & HTML:

    1. I removed any duplicate broken files that were present. ex: "._index.html"
    Anything that your website doesn't need to run should not be in your folder! <3

    2. I also removed the example file that was a second version of your second page. 
    Refer Point One.

    3. You were targeting two of the same bodies in both ur html and css. I fix.
    The <style> element is great and all but it's easier to keep all ur css in the same file. 

    4. I reorganized your divs to make it a little easier for you to work clearly.
    Don't forget to format your document!

     <div id="artistbio">
            <a href=""><img src="images/yellow.png"></img></a>
        </div>

        =>

    <a id="artistbio" href="about.html">
        <img src="./images/yellow.png">
    </a>

Thank God ur Website isn't overly complicated bc this is going to be fairly straight-forward. 
Your only issue was really organizing your code enough so that it is more legible. 

Now you just have 2 important 'Parents' which are the Body and the Canvas div. 
I can explan this more in person but to fix the issue you need to change the way you're targeting your div class & id so that you can know what tweaks what. 

LMAO!!!
Repeat Issue: you were showing an img tag AND making the div behind it show a background img of the same IMG!!! xD
